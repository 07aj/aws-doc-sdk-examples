#  Create AWS Serverless workflows using the Java SDK

You can create an AWS Serverless workflow by using the AWS Java SDK and AWS Step Functions. 
Each workflow step is implemented by using a Lambda function. AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run 
code without provisioning or managing servers.

**Note**: You can create Lambda functions in various programming languages. For this tutorial, Lambda functions are 
implemented by using the Lambda Java API. For more information about Lambda, see 
[What is AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html).
