AWS SDK for JavaScript version 3 (v3) examples
###############################

These are examples for the AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 public documentation.

The `preview of version 3 of the SDK <at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3>`_ is available.

The topic containing this example is in the `AWS SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide v3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/sqs-examples-managing-visibility-timeout.html>`_ .

**NOTE:** The AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 is written in TypeScript so, for consistency, these examples are also in TypeScript. TypeScript extends of JavaScript so these examples can also be run as JavaScript. For more information, see the `TypeScript homepage <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>`_ .

Prerequisites
=============

To build and run these examples, you need to:

- Set up the project environment to run these TypeScript examples with Node.js, and install the required AWS SDK for JavaScript and third-party modules. Follow the instructions in the README.md in the folder with the examples you're running. For example, for these are the `instructions for Amazon S3 examples <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/javascriptv3/example_code/s3/README.md>`_.
- Create a shared configurations file with your user credentials. For more information about providing a shared credentials file, see `Loading credentials in Node.js from the shared credentials file <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html>`_ in the *AWS SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide v3*.

Running the examples
====================

Examples are written for either execution in a browser script or in Node.js, usually depending on the use case for each. The two scenarios typically differ in how you supply credentials to the code. These differences are described in the `AWS SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide v3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials.html>`_.

To run the examples, you'll need to create a shared credentials file. For more information about how to set up a shared credentials file,
see `Loading Credentials in Node.js from the Shared Credentials File <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html>`_
in the *AWS SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide*.

The Node.js examples are all run from the command line.

Documentation
=============

- When it's released, you can find detailed documentation for the `AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide>`_.
